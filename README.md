# Tbh I really can have done better
The biggest mistake I make was not thinking about the design more and how I would make the HTML for them. After that bad start I starter to not care much about this project and become lazy, and with that I make more mistake until it become a spiral where I get lazier and make more mistake untill I became out of controll, so I do my best to salvage it and atleast make it work.

I have learn from my mistake and moving forward I will think thing more throughly before executing my idea. I will also stop myself from going on a spiral of laziness
